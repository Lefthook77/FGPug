Hello, and welcome to Fantasy Guilds Pick Up Game (FG Pug)!
The idea is pretty simple. If you're a DM and have a few games you can run pretty quickly, players will ask you to dance. If you're a player, look for an online DM, and see if they're up for a quick game. Grab other players and jump into a pug room. Pretty simple. Please check out the Rules below:
1. Be respectful. If you're in a Mature room, there are no holds barred on language (no adult images, please), but we can still be respectful. This seems to be the key to good gaming, universally.
2. If you're under 18, please use Pug 3 or Campaign 2.
3. Go easy on new players AND DM's. The more folks we have, the more we can play.

Also, if you need some help learning the ropes as either a player or a DM, please check out our affiliate: Fantasy Grounds College on Discord. They are a fantastic resource, infinitely helpful, and frankly, the Pug wouldn't exist without their awesome students and faculty.

Have fun,

Da Pug
